## The RAL node.js module

I've written this module in order to allow easy use of the RAL color wheel in JS solutions and specifically in the ProtoNFT Avatar Generator my team is building for the NFT Hack Hackathon and the Women in Blockchain community. 

Some of the code here has been adpated from a Flutter app my team has written a few months ago, named ColorMatch. It had some bugs in it actually, so I'm glad I got the chance to rebuild and extend it in JS. 

## How to use the library
